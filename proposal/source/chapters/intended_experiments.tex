\section{Intended Experiments}
This section is going to introduce the intended experiments that will be done with the methods explained in the previous section. 
First of all, the dataset~\cite{dataset-r8r52ohsumed} used for the experiment that will be executed consist of three different dataset called respectively : R8, R52 and Ohsumed. In particular :
\begin{itemize}
    \item R8 and R52 : are subsets of Reuters~\cite{dataset-reuters} 21578 dataset. Such dataset is composed of 12902 documents with 90 classes.
    \item Ohsumed : is a dataset~\cite{dataset-ohsumed} built by excrating medical abstracts from the MEDLINE~\cite{medline-website} database. In particular, it consists of medical abstracts from the MeSH categories of the year 1991 and provides 23 cardiovascular diseases categories as classes.
\end{itemize}
The main experiments that will be run are :
\begin{itemize}
    \item computation of Accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall metrics for different methods introduced in previous section.
    \item analysis of the different metrics depending on the dataset used for training.
    \item train and test with different train-test splits for datsets.
    \item eventually, train and test the previous techniques on other datasets.
\end{itemize}
