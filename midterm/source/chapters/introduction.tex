\section{Introduction}
For this mid-term report we have trained all the models (except the Graph Convolutional Neural Network) with a split of Train-Validation of 80\%-20\% and, we have reported Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Support and Accuracy for each model.
Notice that, in the final report we are going to change also the train-validation split (70\% - 30\%) to have data also regarding that aspect as well. For time reasoning right now we have only collected those results.
